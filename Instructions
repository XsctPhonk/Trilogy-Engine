How to use Bookmarklets, 1st copy the js from the file from this repo that you would like to use, 2nd take it to your bookmark bar and add a bookmark named whatever with the js in the url section but make sure to type Javascript: and add the code without adding a space in between the javascript and the label.                       


How to use console scripts/exploits first open the dev console not the chrome dev console though if you cant get on the dev console use our bookmarklet for it in this repo. Once you have the dev console open go to the script you want to use in this repo and copy it, then paste it into the dev console and enjoy!








Contributions of unblocked games or proxies or ideas for me to turn into a script or a bookmarklet are greatly apreciated. If any of these get patched or blocked then alert me via email or text and i will try to fix them. Visit our website hub for more unblocked games and a lot more!
